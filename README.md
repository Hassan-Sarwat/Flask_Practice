# Flask_Practice

1- The ajax post method was done in the google places api, it's a script in the home.html, the api returns a json link and the ajax function gets that links and changes a <a>'s href attribute
  
2- The api I made is very simple, it takes the number after the /api and add the sum of its integers

3- I use flask framework with mysql db
